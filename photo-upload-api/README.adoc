= Nest API

In this section we are going to learn how to create a server-api that uses NestJs framework. You could find the full documentation of NestJs file uploading https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/file-upload[here].

== Create Project

The first step will be to create a new project running next command:

```bash
nest new photo-upload-api
```

then change the directory of your console running next command:

```bash
cd photo-upload-api
```

== Add Photos Controller

Now we need to create a new controller to handle the uploaded photos. To do that we need to run next command:

```bash
nest g co controllers/photos
```

After that modify `photos.controller.ts` file with next code:

```ts
include::src/controllers/photos/photos.controller.ts[] 
```

== Running the app

Once you have done all that its time to start the server API by running next commands:

=== development

```bash
npm run start
```

=== watch mode
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

=== production mode
```bash
npm run start:prod
```
